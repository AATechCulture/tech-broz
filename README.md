**Accessibility Is The Best Ability**

Ridley is designed to help individuals with mobility challenges easily book and access automated wheelchairs in public places like airports, business centers, and other public venues.

Much like how users can book and unlock Lime scooters via a mobile app, users can book a wheelchair, confirm their reservation, and then scan a QR code displayed on the automated wheelchair's interface to begin their journey.

The app is designed to provide a seamless and accessible experience, offering both a web and mobile version to suit various user preferences.

**Features**

- Book a Wheelchair:
    Users can view a list of available automated wheelchairs nearby and reserve one through a few simple steps.


- QR Code Scanning: 
    After booking, a unique QR code will be displayed on the wheelchair's interface, allowing the user to scan it using the app to unlock and begin their ride.

- Real-time Availability: The app shows real-time wheelchair availability, allowing users to make a reservation for immediate or future use.
